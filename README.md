## Purpose:

The purpose of this website is to raise awareness about men’s mental health, break the stigma surrounding it, and provide resources, support, and education to men and their loved ones. By addressing key issues such as societal expectations, barriers to seeking help, and common mental health challenges, the site aims to create a safe and supportive space where men feel encouraged to prioritize their mental well-being. It also serves as a platform to share personal stories, practical advice, and reliable resources, empowering visitors to take action and foster a more open conversation about mental health.

### Talk about user stories and choice to use the Learning Objectives just as a template and acknowledge the importance of using real stories in a real scenario

## Design Choices:

### Wireframes:

### Colour Palette:

### Font:

For the website, two Google Fonts were chosen: Roboto Slab and Roboto Condensed. These fonts were selected to strike a balance between readability and modern design. Roboto Slab, a serif font, was used as the primary font for its clean, professional appearance, ideal for body text and headings that require clarity. Roboto Condensed, a narrower sans-serif font, was chosen as the secondary font to complement the primary font and add versatility, making it suitable for accent text or subheadings.

### Images:

### Favicon:

The favicon for the website is a cartoon image of a mustache, chosen to symbolically represent masculinity while maintaining a light-hearted and approachable tone. This aligns with the website’s focus on men’s mental health, as the mustache is often associated with campaigns like Movember, which raise awareness about men's health issues.

The favicon was generated using favicon.io.
