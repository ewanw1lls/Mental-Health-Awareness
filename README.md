## Purpose:

The purpose of this website is to raise awareness about men’s mental health, break the stigma surrounding it, and provide resources, support, and education to men and their loved ones. By addressing key issues such as societal expectations, barriers to seeking help, and common mental health challenges, the site aims to create a safe and supportive space where men feel encouraged to prioritize their mental well-being. It also serves as a platform to share personal stories, practical advice, and reliable resources, empowering visitors to take action and foster a more open conversation about mental health.

### Talk about user stories and choice to use the Learning Objectives just as a template and acknowledge the importance of using real stories in a real scenario

## Design Choices:

### Wireframes:

### Colour Palette:

The color palette for the website was designed to convey professionalism, trust, and calmness, aligning with the sensitive subject of men’s mental health. Although two highlight colors were defined but not utilized, including them demonstrates good design practice by providing flexibility for future updates or design tweaks.

Primary Color: #2C3453 (Dark Blue)

This color forms the foundation of the design, symbolizing stability and trust. It was used for primary text and backgrounds to ensure readability and a professional tone.
Secondary Color: #37379D (Blue)

This slightly lighter blue complements the primary color and is used for headings, links, or subtle accents, creating a cohesive design.
Highlight Color: #652D81 (Purple)

While not used in the current design, this rich purple was defined as a potential accent for call-to-action buttons or important sections. Purple is often associated with creativity and introspection, making it a fitting choice for mental health themes.
Highlight Color Light: #6097F5 (Light Blue)

This soft and calming blue was also unused but could serve as a secondary highlight, particularly for hover effects or subtle background gradients.

### Font:

For the website, two Google Fonts were chosen: Roboto Slab and Roboto Condensed. These fonts were selected to strike a balance between readability and modern design. Roboto Slab, a serif font, was used as the primary font for its clean, professional appearance, ideal for body text and headings that require clarity. Roboto Condensed, a narrower sans-serif font, was chosen as the secondary font to complement the primary font and add versatility, making it suitable for accent text or subheadings.

### Images:

The images used on the website were sourced from a mix of stock image websites and Google Images. Stock images were selected for their professional quality and relevance, while additional visuals from Google Images were chosen to capture specific themes and emotions. 

For any future updates, it is recommended to prioritize images from royalty-free or licensed platforms such as Unsplash, Pexels, or Pixabay to avoid potential copyright issues. Including proper attribution for images, where required, ensures compliance with usage rights and ethical standards.

### Favicon:

The favicon for the website is a cartoon image of a mustache, chosen to symbolically represent masculinity while maintaining a light-hearted and approachable tone. This aligns with the website’s focus on men’s mental health, as the mustache is often associated with campaigns like Movember, which raise awareness about men's health issues.

The favicon was generated using favicon.io.
